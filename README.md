# CNN-Output-and-Architecture-Visualization

This project demonstrates the output of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by showcasing what happens in the convolution and max pooling layers. Additionally, it includes visualization of the model architecture using VisualKeras.

## Project Overview

The project is designed to:
1. Display the output of the CNN after applying convolution and max pooling operations.
2. Visualize the architecture of the CNN, including the details of max pooling layers.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and using the CNN model.
- **VisualKeras**: For visualizing the architecture of the CNN.
  
    ```bash
  pip install visualkeras
    
- **Google Colab**: For running the code and experiments.

## Result
The visualizations of the CNN architecture and detailed outputs from convolutional and max pooling layers provide insights into how different layers impact the feature maps and overall output. Explore how the network processes and transforms the input through its layers to understand its inner workings.
